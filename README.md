## Automatic model to extract emotions from English texts via Deep Learning
This was my Master's thesis. 

In this approach, I used a deep learning language model combined with IR techniques to detect emotions from 5428 labeled memories of the 7666 memories in the ISEAR dataset. Below, I have provided the metrics I was able to achieve in detecting emotions from these memories using my method.


|           | Random Forest | SVM   | G-Boosted Tree |
|-----------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| Accuracy  | 0.7           | 0.723 | 0.703          |
| F1-score  | 0.698         | 0.718 | 0.7            |
| Precision | 0.702         | 0.723 | 0.702          |
| Recall    | 0.699         | 0.720 | 0.702          |
