same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her money.", "Then said the gardener\"s boy: \"I am grown up, and will go to the wars also, only give me a horse.\"", "The others laughed, and said: \"Seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you.\"", "When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib, hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark forest.", "When he came to the outskirts, he called \"Iron Hans\" three times so loudly that it echoed through the trees.", "Thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said: \"What do you desire?\"", "I want a strong steed, for I am going to the wars.", "Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him.", "They asked, too: \"Under what hedge have you been lying sleeping all the time?\"", "So he said: \"I did the best of all, and it would have gone badly without me.\"", "And then he was still more ridiculed.\"", "The king said to his daughter: \"I will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple.", "Perhaps the unknown man will show himself.\"", "The king grew angry, and said: \"That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell his name.\"", "He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple, should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.",

one of them got so near him that he wounded the youth\"s leg with the point of his sword.", "The youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently that the helmet fell from the youth\"s head, and they could see that he had golden hair.", "When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle.", "And now the sun went quite down; the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and chin that almost met one another.", "She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away with it in her hand.", "Till the prisoner is fast, And her

spiteful to say to every one.", "The first was too fat: \"He\"s as round as a tub,\" said she.", "The next was too tall: \"What a maypole!\" said she.", "The next was too short: \"What a dumpling!\"

stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker\"s oven.", "And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there.", "Look at him, said she; \"his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.\"", "But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door.", "Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, \"Let him come in.\"", "So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon.", "When this was over the king said, \"Now get ready to go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.\"", "Ah! unlucky wretch that I am! sighed she; \"would that I had married King Grisly-beard!\"", "Next they came to some fine meadows.", "Whose are these beautiful green meadows? said she.", "They belong to King Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.", "Ah! unlucky wretch that I am! said she; \"would that I had married King Grisly-beard!\"", "Then they came to a great city.", "Whose is this noble city? said she.", "It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been thine.", "Ah! wretch that I am! sighed she; \"why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?\"", "That is no business of mine, said the fiddler: \"why should you wish for another husband?", "Am not I good enough for you?\"", "At last they came to a small cottage.", "What a paltry place! said she; \"to whom does that little dirty hole belong?\"", "Then the fiddler said, \"That is your and my house, where we are to live.\"", "Where are your servants? cried she.", "What do we want with servants? said he; \"you must do for yourself whatever is to be done.", "Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.\"", "But the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help her.", "When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house.", "Thus they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, \"Wife, we can\"t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing.", "You must learn to weave baskets.\"", "Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore.", "I see this work wont do,\" said he: \"try and spin; perhaps you will do that better.\"", "See now, said the fiddler, \"you are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got!", "However, I\"ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.\"", "Alas! sighed she, \"if any of my father\"s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!\"", "But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she did not wish to die of hunger.", "Who would have thought you would have been so silly, said he, \"as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of work, so I have been to the king\"s palace, and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will have plenty to eat.\"", "This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce lion, and roared out, \"Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up alive!\"", "No! said the lion, \"nothing, unless you undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your daughter.\"", "However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care no light should fall upon him.", "She ran home crying to tell of her misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving her a violent scolding, said unkindly, \"As you have let the spindle fall into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.\"", "But she only answered, \"A nice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,\" and passed on.", "The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up.", "So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she might go.", "That is in return for your services, said the old woman, and she shut the gate.", "So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the well called out as she saw her:", "But what can we do with him? said the shepherd, \"he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves don\"t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.\"", "No, said the Sultan; \"I will be true to my master.\"", "Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan \"an old rogue,\" and swore he would have his revenge.", "So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter.", "The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, \"Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.\"", "So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.", "If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.", "How can you dare, said she with angry look, \"descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief?", "You shall suffer for it!\"", "Ah! you wicked child, cried the enchantress.", "What do I hear you say!\r\n43:43\tA:A\tA:F\tI thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me!", "In her anger she clutched Rapunzel\"s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.", "And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.", "On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king\"s son came and cried:", "Aha! she cried mockingly, \"you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well.", "Rapunzel is lost to you; you will never see her again.\"", "Some witch told you that!-- some witch told you that! cried the little man, and

see, But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!", "When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, \"Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may

fairest in all this land: But over the hills, in the greenwood shade, Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made, There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.",

dwelt.", "Theres an end to all thy beauty,\" said the spiteful queen, and went away home.", "Then they said, \"The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.\"", "When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said:", "Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land: But over the hills, in the greenwood shade, Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made, There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.", "Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb.", "When she reached the dwarfs\" cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, \"Fine wares to sell!\"", "But Snowdrop said, \"I dare not let anyone in.\"", "Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before; and she said, \"Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.\"", "So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die.", "You silly girl! answered the other, \"what are you afraid of?", "Do you think it is poisoned?", "Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.\"", "When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride.", "And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need.", "The stepdaughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and told her mother that she must and would have that apron.", "Be quiet, my child, said the old woman, \"and you shall have it.", "Your stepsister has long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her head off.", "Then the witch cried: \"Where are you?\"", "The old woman went out, but saw no one on the stairs, and cried again: \"Where are you?\"", "The witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart Roland.", "That shall not help you, cried she, \"even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.\"", "She put on her many-league boots, in which she covered an hour\"s walk at every step, and it was not long before she overtook them.", "The witch placed herself on the shore, threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come.", "It was not long before the witch came striding up towards them, and said to the musician: \"Dear musician, may I pluck that beautiful flower for myself?\"", "As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced to dance, for it was a magical dance.", "The faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.", "Thats a good joke!\" said Chanticleer; \"no, that will never do; I had rather by half walk home; I\"ll sit on the box and be coachman, if you like, but I\"ll not draw.\"", "While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, \"You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds?", "I\"ll give it you well for your insolence!\" and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily.", "But Chanticleer was no coward, and returned the duck\"s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them.", "Bless me! said he, \"all the world seems to have a design against my head this morning\": and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the pain was not in his head.", "He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.", "Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed;

down on his head, and killed him on the spot.", "Oho! she answered, \"who gives anything to a run-away soldier?", "The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away.",

the broom and sweep the chamber.\"", "When she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: \"Pull off my boots,\" and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them.", "She, however, did everything he bade her, without opposition, silently and with halfshut eyes.", "Do what I bid you, replied the

manikin fell on them like lightning, darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again.", "The king was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier\"s mercy, and merely to be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his daughter to wife.", "Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.\"", "But the

brute, \"what harm can you do me?\" and passed on.", "But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and than all the wine ran out,

up and kicked.", "When the carter saw this, he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse\"s head with such force, that he fell down dead.", "Unlucky wretch that I am! cried he.", "Not wretch enough yet! said the sparrow.", "When the carter saw this, he again cried out, \"Miserable wretch that I am!\"",

flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the spot.", "Unlucky wretch that I am! said he.", "Not wretch enough yet! said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too.", "The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his third horse as he done the other two.", "Alas! miserable wretch that I am! cried he.", "Not wretch enough yet! answered the sparrow as she flew away; \"now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.\"", "The carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home overflowing with rage and vexation.", "Alas! said he to his wife, \"what ill luck has befallen me! --my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead.\"", "Alas! husband, replied she, \"and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up

yet!\" and away she flew.", "The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner.", "But the sparrow sat on the outside of the window, and cried \"Carter! thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life!\"", "With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet, and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the window.", "The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the windowseat, and cried, \"Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!\"", "Then he became mad

furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all.", "In the end, however, they caught her: and the wife said, \"Shall I kill her at once?\"", "No, cried he, \"that is letting her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat her.\"", "But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck and cried, \"Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!\"", "With that he could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, \"Wife, strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.\"", "Did not you ask it for

she, \"I will be pope this very day.\"", "What nonsense! said she; \"if he can make an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.\"", "What does she want now? said the fish.", "Go home, said the fish; \"she is pope already.\"", "Ha! thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, \"after all I cannot prevent the sun rising.\"", "At this thought she was very angry, and wakened

fish at once!\"", "What does she want now? said the fish.", "Go home, said the fish, \"to your pigsty again.\"", "No, said the other, \"that is not an honest calling, and what can one look to earn by

that first, said Heinel, \"so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.\"", "The old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could.", "At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son.", "He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.", "False and fickle one! said he.", "One indeed came who set thee free, and he is now near thee again; but how have you used him?\r\n84:84\tN:N\tN:A\tOught he to have had such treatment from thee?", "Then he went out and sent away the company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back to the kingdom.", "Then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he drew his sword.", "Heads Off! cried he; and with the word the traitors\" heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king of the Golden Mountain.", "At night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: \"If you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don\"t care to drag you home again in my arms.\"", "It would not stop and come with us.\"", "The peasant, however, said: \"Don\"t tell me that,\" and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.", "The peasant listened, and when he heard them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make shift with a slice of bread and cheese.", "Then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.", "Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside.", "The woman said: \"Oh, heavens!", "The miller saw the peasant lying on the straw, and asked, \"What is that fellow doing there?\"", "The woman said: \"But I have nothing but bread and cheese.\"", "The miller said: \"The Devil must go out,\" and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet.", "The mayor, however, said: \"But my servant must go first.\"", "When she came to the merchant in the town, he did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others came, he did not give them so much, and said: \"What can I do with all these skins?\"", "Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this treachery before the major.", "The innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes.", "He was led forth, and a priest was brought who was to say a mass for his soul.", "A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for him three years, without having been paid any wages.", "At last it came into the man\"s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer; so he went to his master, and said, \"I have worked hard for you a long time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my trouble.\"", "The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year\"s service a penny.", "The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air.", "Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough, said the other; \"thou art only meeting thy reward\": so he played up another tune.", "Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick.", "At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck.", "Then the judge sent out his officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he was soon caught and brought up to be tried.", "The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money.", "No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you. said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.", "Anything but thy life, replied the other.", "The miser cried out, \"Oh, no! no! for heaven\"s sake don\"t listen to him! don\"t listen to him!\"", "But the judge said, \"It is only this once, he will soon have done.\"", "The fact was, he could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf\"s third gift.", "But the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser.", "At the second note the hangman let his prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and all the people who had followed to look on.", "Then he called to the miser, and said, \"Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,\" \"I stole it,\" said the miser in the presence of all the people; \"I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.\"", "Then the countryman stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.", "But the other bird sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it.", "Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work.", "Beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made.", "The bird complained to the dog of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.", "The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed.", "What are you doing there? asked the father.", "Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts.", "When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up.", "Here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger.", "So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: \"Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.\"", "The cook once more said: \"If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.\"", "Then the wicked wretch came in and said: \"Where are the boy\"s heart and tongue?\"", "The girl reached the plate to him, but the king\"s son threw off the quilt, and said: \"You old sinner, why did you want to kill me?", "Now will I pronounce thy sentence.", "You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your throat.\"", "But the king replied: \"She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will not have her named.\"", "Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said: \"That is the wretch!\" and caused live coals to be brought, and these the dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst forth from its throat.", "On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side.", "When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon.", "The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs.", "One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not quiet it, do what she would.", "She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: \"I wish you were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.\"", "But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, \"If you will not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink counts for nothing,\" and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and drank.", "At two o\"clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses; but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, \"I know he has fallen asleep.\"", "When she entered the garden, there she found him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep.", "She got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.", "You are not eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?\"", "They stopped when they heard the call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their fighting, which now became more furious.", "God be with you, he cried again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went back to their fighting.", "They had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would separate.", "Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after another, crying, \"There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you deserve; are you satisfied now!\"", "They were all drunk, and paid no heed to her cries and lamentations.", "When he had gone a hundred steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself.", "Now the old woman was a witch, and said to the young lady, \"There is a young man coming out of the wood who carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child, for it is more fit for us than for him.", "Then the old woman said, \"Now is the time for getting the bird\"s heart.\"", "Well, said the old witch, \"we have got the bird\"s heart, but not the wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.\"", "Then the witch was very angry, and said, \"Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing, and I must and will have it.\"", "When the giants came up to him, the first pushed him with his foot, and said, \"What worm is this that lies here curled up?\"", "Tread upon him and kill him, said the second.", "Its not worth the trouble,\" said the third; \"let him live, he\"ll go climbing higher up the mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.\"", "Countryman, said the witch, \"who are you? and what is your business?\"", "Now you shall be paid for your roguery, said he; and tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he came to a mill and knocked at the window.", "Whats the matter?\" said the miller.", "I have three tiresome beasts here, said the other; \"if you will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you, I will pay you whatever you ask.\"", "With all my heart, said the miller; \"but how shall I treat them?\"", "Then the huntsman said, \"Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes\": for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.", "In the meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the young men stay so long.", "Surely, said he, \"the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play\"; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens.", "When they came in, they wanted to eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses.", "Who has eaten from my little plate?\r\n26:26\tA:N\tF:A\tAnd who has been drinking out of my little glass?", "Caw!\r\n28:28\tA:A\tF:A\tCaw! well I ween Mortal lips have this way been.", "Look how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.\"", "He will never be good for anything as long as he lives!", "The father sighed, and answered him: \"You shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.\"", "Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing.", "Just think, said he, \"when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder.\"", "If that be all, replied the sexton, \"he can learn that with me.", "Send him to me, and I will soon polish him.\"", "The father was glad to do it, for he thought: \"It will train the boy a little.\"", "The sexton therefore took him into his house, and he had to ring the church bell.", "After a day or two, the sexton awoke him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and ring the bell.", "You shall soon learn what shuddering is, thought he, and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole.", "Who is there? cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did not move or stir.", "Give an answer, cried the boy, \"or take yourself off, you have no business here at night.\"", "The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost.", "The boy cried a second time: \"What do you want here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the steps!\"", "The sexton thought: \"He can\"t mean to be as bad as his words,\" uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone.", "Then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner.", "Thereupon he rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and fell asleep.", "Just go there and you will see if it was he.", "She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy\"s father, \"Your boy,\" cried she, \"has been the cause of a great misfortune!", "He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg.", "Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.\"", "The father was terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy.", "What wicked tricks are these? said he.", "The devil must have put them into your head.", "Father, he replied, \"do listen to me.", "I am quite innocent.", "He was standing there by night like one intent on doing evil.", "I did not know who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go away.\"", "Ah, said the father, \"I have nothing but unhappiness with you.", "Go out of my sight.", "I will see you no more.\"", "Learn what you will, spoke the father, \"it is all the same to me.", "So he said: \"Take care, or I will hang you up again.\"", "At this he grew angry, and said: \"If you will not take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,\" and he hung them up again each in his turn.", "Then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers, and said: \"Well do you know how to shudder?\"", "No, answered he, \"how should I know?", "Those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burnt.\"", "Then the man saw that he would not get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: \"Such a youth has never come my way before.\"", "What is it that you are always muttering between your teeth?", "Enough of your foolish chatter, said the waggoner.", "He let the host have no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was, if he would but watch in it for three nights.", "Towards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly from one corner: \"Au, miau! how cold we are!\"", "You fools! cried he, \"what are you crying about?", "If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.\"", "And when he had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes.", "Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast.", "I have looked at your fingers, said he, \"and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\" and he struck them dead and threw them out into the water.", "But when he had made away with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put it out.", "He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: \"Away with you, vermin,\" and began to cut them down.", "Some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond.", "When he came back he fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed himself.", "And as he thus sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep.", "Then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner.", "This is not enough!\"", "That is no part of our bargain, said the youth, \"the bench is mine.\"", "The man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself again in his own place.", "Then still more men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men\"s legs and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them.", "The dead man, however, got up and cried: \"Now will I strangle you.\"", "What! said he, \"is that the way you thank me?", "You shall at once go into your coffin again,\" and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut the lid.", "Then came the six men and carried him away again.", "I cannot manage to shudder, said he.", "You wretch, cried he, \"you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.\"", "Not so fast, replied the youth.", "If I am to die, I shall have to have a say in it.", "I will soon seize you, said the fiend.", "Softly, softly, do not talk so big.\r\n184:184\tA:N\tA:F\tI am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.", "We shall see, said the old man.", "If you are stronger, I will let you go--come, we will try.", "Then he led him by dark passages to a smith\"s forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.", "I can do better than that, said the youth, and went to the other anvil.", "The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down.", "Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil with one blow, and in it caught the old man\"s beard.", "Now I have you, said the youth.", "Now it is your turn to die.", "Then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he would give him great riches.", "The youth drew out the axe and let him go.", "And this at last angered her.", "Her waiting-maid said: \"I will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.\"", "At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would sprawl about him.", "Then said the father: \"Hark you, my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head.", "You must go from hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall see what he can do with you.\"", "Lord have mercy on us! cried the father; \"is that all you have learnt?", "I will send you into another town, to another master.\"", "The youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise.", "When he came back the father again asked: \"My son, what have you learnt?\"", "He answered: \"Father, I have learnt what the birds say.\"", "Then the father fell into a rage and said: \"Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes?", "I will send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I will no longer be your father.\"", "The youth remained a whole year with the third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired: \"My son, what have you learnt?\" he answered: \"Dear father, I have this year learnt what the frogs croak.\"", "Then the father fell into the most furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: \"This man is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him out into the forest, and kill him.\"", "They took him forth, but when they should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go, and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry them to the old man as a token.", "But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than the rest, went to see what was going on.", "But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face, and spat, and scratched at him.", "One day he said to himself, \"What shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another; and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.\"", "When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself.", "However, he determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so much for only a turnip, what must his present be wroth?", "When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite; and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to kill his brother.", "So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, \"Dear brother, I have found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between us.\"", "So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith, for his thirst for knowledge was great.", "Now then, cried he, \"let me ascend quickly.\"", "The same thing happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off.", "After him came several others; but they had all the same luck, and all lost their lives in the same manner.", "And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping draught, he would have slept soundly enough.\"", "You silly creature! said the eldest, \"it is nothing but a nail in the wall.\"", "But the eldest said, \"It is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.\"", "It came to pass that one evening he said to the king: \"You think you have twelve huntsmen?\"", "The lion continued: \"You are mistaken, they are twelve girls.\"", "The king said: \"That cannot be true!", "How will you prove that to me?\"", "Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber, answered the lion, \"and then you will soon see.", "Men have a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.\"", "The king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.", "Then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: \"You have lied to me, they walk just like men.\"", "The lion said: \"They have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength.", "Just let twelve spinning-wheels be brought into the antechamber, and they will go to them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.\"", "The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber.", "Then the king again said to the lion: \"You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the spinning-wheels.\"", "The lion replied: \"They have restrained themselves.\"", "The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.", "The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling.", "Hi! who invited you? said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away.", "The little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying: \"Wait, and I will give it to you,\" struck it mercilessly on them.", "The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said: \"You ragamuffin!", "You miserable creature!\"", "When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the grasshopper for good.", "The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished him a thousand miles away.", "What is to be the end of this? they said among themselves.", "The king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him again.", "For a long time the giant felt nothing, but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: \"Why are you knocking me?\"", "What is the meaning of this? cried the other \"Why are you pelting me?\"", "I am not pelting you, answered the first, growling.", "They disputed about it for a time, but as they were weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more.", "That is too bad! cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook.", "The other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time.", "The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more ado.", "When the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once, and in one bound out again.", "The boar ran after him, but the tailor ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window, was caught.", "After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at night: \"Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I will rap the yard-measure over your ears.\"", "Ill put a screw into that business,\" said the little tailor.", "At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door, and then lay down again.", "The little tailor, who was only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: \"Boy, make me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your ears.", "I smote seven at one blow.", "I killed two giants, I brought away one unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing outside the room.\"", "When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against him.", "What is that to thee, you ugly imp? said the prince haughtily, and rode on.", "But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round.", "The king was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.", "Mind your own affairs, busybody! said the prince scornfully, and rode on.", "But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains.", "Thus it is with proud silly people, who think themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.",

dwarf at last set them free, though unwillingly, saying, \"Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.\"", "When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage the two eldest said to themselves, \"Our brother has got the water which we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the kingdom, which is our right\"; so they were full of envy and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin him.", "Then they waited till he was fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.", "When they came to their journey\"s end, the youngest son brought his cup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed.", "Scarcely, however, had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father, but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.", "He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.", "Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, \"Well, brother, you found the Water of Life, did you?", "You have had the trouble and we shall have the reward.", "Pray, with all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your eyes open?", "Next year one of us will take away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care.", "You had better say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we will let you off.\"", "The old king was still very angry with his youngest son,

we ought to be easy with this pretty cottage to live in.\"", "The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said:", "The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, \"Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.\"", "Wife, wife, said the man, \"why should we wish to be the king?", "This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out:", "O man of the sea!\r\n48:48\tN:N\tF:S\tHearken to me!\r\n49:49\tN:N\tF:S\tMy wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!", "And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, \"Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king!", "Ah, wife! replied the fisherman, \"the fish cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing.\"", "So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, \"This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.\"", "He soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near as he could to the water\"s brink, and said:", "O man of the sea!\r\n69:69\tN:N\tF:S\tHearken to me!\r\n70:70\tN:N\tF:S\tMy wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!", "Ah! said the fisherman, \"she wants to be emperor.\"", "So he went home again;

and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.\"", "I will think about that, said the wife.", "The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.", "Alas, wife! said he, \"cannot you be easy with being pope?\"", "Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook.", "And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon their heads.", "And the fisherman crept towards the sea, and cried out, as well as he could:", "O man of the sea!\r\n113:113\tN:N\tF:F\tHearken to me!\r\n114:114\tN:N\tF:F\tMy wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!", "Ah! said he, \"she wants to be lord of the sun and moon.\"", "I dare not shoot at him, said the huntsman, \"for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.\"", "They were still not safe;

but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch.", "As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener\"s son jumped up and shot an arrow at it.", "Then the fox said, \"Do not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and that you want to find the golden bird.", "Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his coming back.", "But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king.", "The next morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird given him for his own.", "So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair, when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, \"You see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel.", "I will still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as I bid you.", "You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.\"", "Then the son sat down on the fox\"s tail, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.", "All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden saddle.", "But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity to put the leathern saddle upon it.", "I will give him the good one, said he; \"I am sure he deserves it.\"", "As he took up the golden saddle the groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court to be judged, and was sentenced to die.", "But it was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own.", "Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, \"Why did not you listen to me?", "If you had, you would have carried away both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel.", "Go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle.", "At twelve o\"clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.\"", "Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled again.", "As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o\"clock the young man met the princes going to the bath and gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father.", "At first he refused, but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last he consented; but the moment she came to her father\"s house the guards awoke and he was taken prisoner again.", "Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, \"You shall never have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops the view from my window.\"", "Now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said.", "But the young man refused to do it: so the fox said, \"I will at any rate give you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows, and sit down by the side of no river.\"", "Then away he went.", "Well, thought the young man, \"it is no hard matter to keep that advice.\"", "He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where he had left his two brothers.", "Then he pulled him out of the river, and said to him, as he got upon the bank, \"Your brothers have set watch to kill you, if they find you in the kingdom.\"", "But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up.", "His punishment, however, was not delayed;

the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free.", "But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.", "Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh.", "So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her.", "Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-inlaw, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine.", "Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face.", "Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: \"I have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!\"", "There, I can help you, said Dummling, \"just come with me and you shall be satisfied.\"", "Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: \"I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I?", "My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger.\"", "At this Dummling was glad, and said: \"Get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full.\"", "He led him to the king\"s palace where all the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked.", "The man from the forest stood before it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.", "Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey man to whom he had given his cake.", "She drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left school to the time he went back.", "Mother, said the boy, \"how dreadful you look!", "Yes, give me an apple.\"", "Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.", "If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it, she thought.", "So she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy\"s head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.", "Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, \"Mother, brother is sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;

flowering convolvuli and brambles were hanging like garlands from tree to tree; while the nightingales were singing and the sunbeams played.", "That was very beautiful!", "We must try to find out if it is!", "Therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast; but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced, and sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear the sounds from the confectioner's stall, where the others were singing at tea.", "That he had done, and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes, for the sound of the bell was too enticing- he felt he must go on.", "We might go together, said the king's son.", "I will and must find the bell, he said, \"if I have to go to the end of the world.\"", "But he walked on undaunted, deeper and deeper into the wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing;

and if the bark was split of any of them, long blades of grass grew out of the clefts; there were also large smooth lakes in the wood, on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings.", "The king's son often stood still and listened; sometimes he thought that the sound of the bell rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes, but soon he found that this was a mistake, and that the bell was ringing still farther in the wood.", "Oh, what a splendour!", "The sea, the great majestic sea, which was rolling its long waves against the shore, stretched out before him, and the sun was standing like a large bright altar and there where sea and heaven met- all melted together in the most glowing colours; the wood was singing, and his heart too.", "The whole of nature was one large holy church, in which the trees and hovering clouds formed the pillars, the flowers and grass the woven velvet carpet, and heaven itself was the great cupola; up there the flame colour vanished as soon as the sun disappeared, but millions of stars were lighted; diamond lamps were shining, and the king's son stretched his arms out towards heaven, towards the sea, and towards the wood.", "And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.", "Ding-dong! ding-dong! sounded the Bell, when the tower still stood there; and one evening, while the sun was setting, and the Bell was swinging away bravely, it broke loose and came flying down through the air, the brilliant metal shining in the ruddy beam.", "Ding-dong! ding-dong!\r\n11:11\tH:H\tH:N\tNow I'll retire to rest! sang the Bell, and flew down into the Odense-Au, where it is deepest; and that is why the place is called the \"bell-deep.\"", "Down in the Au-mann's haunt it sounds and rings, so that the tones sometimes pierce upward through the waters; and many people maintain that its strains forebode the death of some one; but that is not true, for the Bell is only talking with the Au-mann, who is now no longer alone.", "And what is the Bell telling?", "It is old, very old, as we have already observed; it was there long before grandmother's grandmother was born; and yet it is but a child in comparison with the Au-mann, who is quite an old quiet personage, an oddity, with his hose of eel-skin, and his scaly Jacket with the yellow lilies for buttons, and a wreath of reed in his hair and seaweed in his beard; but he looks very pretty for all that.", "What the Bell tells?", "To repeat it all would require years and days; for year by year it is telling the old stories, sometimes short ones, sometimes long ones, according to its whim; it tells of old times, of the dark hard times, thus: \"In the church of St. Alban, the monk had mounted up into the tower.", "He was young and handsome, but thoughtful exceedingly.", "He looked through the loophole out upon the Odense-Au, when the bed of the water was yet broad, and the monks' meadow was still a lake.", "He looked out over it, and over the rampart, and over the nuns' hill opposite, where the convent lay, and the light gleamed forth from the nun's cell.", "He had known the nun right well, and he thought of her, and his heart beat quicker as he thought.", "Ding-dong! ding-dong!\"", "Yes, this was the story the Bell told.", "The church bell hangs high, and looks far around, and sees the birds around it, and understands their language.\r\n44:44\tH:N\tS:N\tThe wind roars in upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows everything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all things, and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it out into the world, 'Ding-dong! ding-dong!'\r\n45:45\tSa:N\tS:N\tBut it was too much for me to hear and to know; I was not able any longer to ring it out.", "And when all the other church bells are sounding sweetly, he says that it is not really the bells that are sounding, but that it is the air itself which sends forth the notes; and grandmother said to us that the Bell itself said it was the air who told it to him, consequently they are agreed on that point, and this much is sure.", "The air knows everything.", "It is around us, it is in us, it talks of our thoughts and of our deeds, and it speaks longer of them than does the Bell down in the depths of the Odense-Au where the Au-mann dwells.", "It rings it out in the vault of heaven, far, far out, forever and ever, till the heaven bells sound \"Ding-dong! ding-dong!\"", "He seized her hand, he embraced her, and the mother wept.", "For years she had not been able to weep, but had only bitten her lips till the blood started.", "In comfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and friendly faces.", "They are addressed in the language of their country, and the piano sounds for them with melodies of their native land; and before these have died away, the chord has been struck, the wire of thought that reaches to the land of the sufferers announces that they are rescued.", "Then their anxieties are dispelled; and at even they join in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at Borglum.", "Waltzes and Styrian dances are given, and Danish popular songs, and melodies of foreign lands in these modern times.", "Blessed be thou, new time!", "Speak thou of summer and of purer gales!", "Send thy sunbeams gleaming into our hearts and thoughts!", "On thy glowing canvas let them be painted- the dark legends of the rough hard times that are past!", "An old maid stood at the window; she had hung chickweed over the cage, and the little linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and twittered merrily.", "Yes, it's all very well for you to sing, said the bottle neck: that is, he did not really speak the words as we do, for the neck of a bottle cannot speak; but he thought them to himself in his own mind, just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves.", "The little bird sang his own song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to and fro, every one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply.", "There were sounds of song within the bottle, of things it could not understand, of green sunny mountains, where the vines grow and where the merry vine-dressers laugh, sing, and are merry.", "Ah, how beautiful is life.", "All these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the working of a young poet's brain, who often knows not the meaning of the tones which are sounding within him.", "She was young and pretty; her brown eyes laughed, and a smile lingered round her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes.", "She had delicate hands, beautifully white, and her neck was whiter still.", "It remained there a long time; but when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something pleasant had happened, for every one was laughing; the furrier's daughter laughed too, but she said very little, and her cheeks were like two roses.", "Then her father took the bottle and the cork-screw into his hands.", "What a strange sensation it was to have the cork drawn for the first time!", "The bottle could never after that forget the performance of that moment; indeed there was quite a convulsion within him as the cork flew out, and a gurgling sound as the wine was poured forth into the glasses.", "Long life to the betrothed, cried the papa, and every glass was emptied to the dregs, while the young sailor kissed his beautiful bride.", "Happiness and blessing to you both, said the old people-father and mother, and the young man filled the glasses again.", "Safe return, and a wedding this day next year, he cried; and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, and said, \"Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life; thou shalt never be used by others!\"", "So saying, he hurled it high in the air.", "He could no longer see the betrothed couple, nor the cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing.", "Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great lark,\" \"Peter Jensen's lark.\"", "It had returned home, and the language was as a welcome greeting.", "For very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten.", "There's no place like home, even if it's a cellar.", "It never occurred to him to think that he might lie there for years, he felt so comfortable.", "The stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes.", "The illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden walks, at least not so retired that any one need lose himself there.", "Everything here appeared lovely to our bottle, for it was again in the green wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song, and the noise and murmur of a crowd, especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanterns displayed their brilliant colors.", "It stood in a distant walk certainly, but a place pleasant for contemplation; and it carried a light; and was at once useful and ornamental.", "In such an hour it is easy to forget that one has spent twenty years in a loft, and a good thing it is to be able to do so.", "Close before the bottle passed a single pair, like the bridal pair- the mate and the furrier's daughter- who had so long ago wandered in the wood.", "It seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again.", "Not only the guests but other people were walking in the garden, who were allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities.", "She was thinking, like the bottle, of the green wood, and of a young betrothed pair, who were closely connected with herself; she was thinking of that hour, the happiest of her life, in which she had taken part, when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours are never to be forgotten, let a maiden be as old as she may.", "The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute.", "Then the ropes which held it were cut through, and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket containing the bottle and the rabbit, while the music sounded and all the people shouted \"Hurrah.\"", "This is a wonderful journey up into the air, thought the bottle; \"it is a new way of sailing, and here, at least, there is no fear of striking against anything.\"", "Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered more merrily than ever.", "Do you see how splendidly the tree has grown?", "Before the sprig you gave me faded, I took a spray, and planted it in the earth; and now, as you see, it has become a large tree, and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a wedding festival, in the bouquet of your daughter.\"", "There were tears in the eyes of the old maid, as she spoke of the beloved of her youth, and of their betrothal in the wood.", "Many thoughts came into her mind;

and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer's wife, but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under the table.", "So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry.", "I should like to see him now, while I am so merry.", "Oh, I am not afraid.\r\n62:62\tN:N\tN:N\tWhat will he be like?", "Now then, I have got up my courage, but don't let him come too near me.\"", "I have been well paid for my horse, said he to himself when he reached home, entered his own room, and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor.", "With all my heart, replied the drover, opening the sack, from which sprung Little Claus as quickly as possible.", "Ah, it is because I have been to a church.", "I'll tell you the whole story, and thank you for drowning me; I am above you now, I am really very rich.\r\n184:184\tN:F\tN:F\tI was frightened, to be sure, while I lay tied up in the sack, and the wind whistled in my ears when you threw me into the river from the bridge, and I sank to the bottom immediately; but I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon beautifully soft grass which grows down there; and in a moment, the sack opened, and the sweetest little maiden came towards me.\r\n185:185\tN:N\tN:N\tShe had snow-white robes, and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair.\r\n186:186\tN:N\tN:N\tShe took me by the hand, and said, 'So you are come, Little Claus, and here are some cattle for you to begin with.\r\n187:187\tN:N\tN:N\tAbout a mile farther on the road, there is another herd for you.'\r\n188:188\tN:N\tN:N\tThen I saw that the river formed a great highway for the people who live in the sea.\r\n189:189\tN:N\tN:N\tThey were walking and driving here and there from the sea to the land at the, spot where the river terminates.\r\n190:190\tN:N\tN:N\tThe bed of the river was covered with the loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass.\r\n191:191\tN:N\tN:N\tThe fish swam past me as rapidly as the birds do here in the air.\r\n192:192\tN:N\tN:N\tHow handsome all the people were, and what fine cattle were grazing on the hills and in the valleys!", "However if you will go there first, and then creep into a sack, I will throw you in with the greatest pleasure.\"", "Thank you, said Great Claus; \"but remember, if I do not get any sea-cattle down there I shall come up again and give you a good thrashing.\"", "At the same time, the kind-hearted old man who lived by himself in the upper storey of the house came in; he led a lonely life, for he had no wife and children; but he loved the children of others very much, and he could tell so many fairy tales and stories, that it was a pleasure to hear him.", "Yes, if I only knew a fresh one, said the old man, and nodded smilingly.", "Will not one knock soon? asked the boy; and the mother smiled while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling water over them.", "Yes, if stories came by themselves; they are so proud, they only come when they please.- But wait, he said suddenly, \"there is one.", "And the little boy looked at the teapot; the lid rose up gradually, the elder-tree blossoms sprang forth one by one, fresh and white; long boughs came forth; even out of the spout they grew up in all directions, and formed a bush- nay, a large elder tree, which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains aside; and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance!", "In the midst of the tree sat a kindly-looking old woman with a strange dress; it was as green as the leaves, and trimmed with large white blossoms, so that it was difficult to say whether it was real cloth, or the leaves and blossoms of the elder-tree.", "Just such a large tree, covered with flowers, stands out there; it grew in the corner of an humble little yard; under this tree sat two old people one afternoon in the beautiful sunshine.\r\n28:28\tH:H\tH:H\tHe was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here.\r\n29:29\tN:N\tH:H\t'I know very well when the golden wedding is to take place,' she said; but they did not hear it- they were talking of bygone days.\r\n30:30\tN:N\tH:H\t'Well, do you remember?' said the old sailor, 'when we were quite small and used to run about and play- it was in the very same yard where we now are- we used to put little branches into the ground and make a garden.'", "'I did not know that it was you- you had come as quickly as your letter; and you looked so handsome, and so you do still.\r\n46:46\tN:N\tH:H\tYou had a large yellow silk handkerchief in your pocket and a shining hat on.\r\n47:47\tH:N\tH:H\tYou looked so well, and the weather in the street was horrible!'\r\n48:48\tH:N\tH:H\t'Then we married,' he said.", "'Do you remember how we got our first boy, and then Mary, Niels, Peter, John, and Christian?' 'Oh yes; and now they have all grown up, and have become useful members of society, whom everybody cares for.'", "'And their children have had children again,' said the old sailor.\r\n51:51\tN:N\tH:H\t'Yes, these are children's children, and they are strong and healthy.\r\n52:52\tN:N\tH:H\tIf I am not mistaken, our wedding took place at this season of the year.'\r\n53:53\tH:N\tH:H\t'Yes, to-day is your golden wedding-day,' said the little elder-tree mother, stretching her head down between the two old people, who thought that she was their neighbour who was nodding to them; they looked at each other and clasped hands.", "Soon afterwards the children and grandchildren came, for they knew very well that it was the golden wedding-day; they had already wished them joy and happiness in the morning, but the old people had forgotten it, although they remembered things so well that had passed many, many years ago.", "The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others.\"", "But that was no fairy tale, said the little boy who had listened to it.", "And then she took the little boy out of bed and placed him on her bosom; the elder branches, full of blossoms, closed over them; it was as if they sat in a thick leafy bower which flew with them through the air; it was beautiful beyond all description.", "The little elder-tree mother had suddenly become a charming young girl, but her dress was still of the same green material, covered with white blossoms, as the elder-tree mother had worn; she had a real elder blossom on her bosom, and a wreath of the same flowers was wound round her curly golden hair; her eyes were so large and so blue that it was wonderful to look at them.", "She and the boy kissed each other, and then they were of the same age and felt the same joys.", "They walked hand in hand out of the bower, and now stood at home in a beautiful flower garden.", "Near the green lawn the father's walking-stick was tied to a post.", "There was life in this stick for the little ones, for as soon as they seated themselves upon it the polished knob turned into a neighing horse's head, a long black mane was fluttering in the wind, and four strong slender legs grew out.", "The animal was fiery and spirited; they galloped round the lawn.", "Hooray! now we shall ride far away, many miles! said the boy; \"we shall ride to the nobleman's estate where we were last year.\"", "And they rode round the lawn again, and the little girl, who, as we know, was no other than the little elder-tree mother, continually cried, \"Now we are in the country!", "And they passed by everything the little girl, who was sitting behind on the stick, described, and the boy saw it, and yet they only went round the lawn.", "Then they played in a side-walk, and marked out a little garden on the ground; she took elder-blossoms out of her hair and planted them, and they grew exactly like those the old people planted when they were children, as we have heard before.", "It was spring and it became summer, it was autumn and it became winter, and thousands of pictures reflected themselves in the boy's eyes and heart, and the little girl always sang again, \"You will never forget that!\"", "It is beautiful here in spring, said the little girl, and they were again in the green beechwood, where the thyme breathed forth sweet fragrance at their feet, and the pink anemones looked lovely in the green moss.", "Oh! that it were always spring in the fragrant beechwood!", "Here it is splendid in summer! she said, and they passed by old castles of the age of chivalry.", "The high walls and indented battlements were reflected in the water of the ditches, on which swans were swimming and peering into the old shady avenues.", "In the evening the moon rose, large and round, and the hayricks in the meadows smelt sweetly.", "One can never forget it!", "Here it is beautiful in autumn! said the little girl, and the atmosphere seemed twice as high and blue, while the wood shone with crimson, green, and gold.", "It could not be more pleasant anywhere.", "Here it's agreeable in winter! said the little girl, and all the trees were covered with hoar-frost, so that they looked like white coral.", "In the room the Christmas tree was lit, and there were song and merriment.", "In the peasant's cottage the violin sounded, and games were played for apple quarters; even the poorest child said, \"It is beautiful in winter!\"", "And indeed it was beautiful!", "He distinctly saw the little girl, with her bright blue eyes, peeping out from behind the petals, and heard her whispering, \"Here it is beautiful in spring, in summer, in autumn, and in winter,\" and hundreds of pictures passed through his mind.", "He had now become an old man, and was sitting, with his old wife, under an elder-tree in full bloom.", "They held each other by the hand exactly as the great-grandfather and the great-grandmother had done outside, and, like them, they talked about bygone days and of their golden wedding.", "The little girl with the blue eyes and elder-blossoms in her hair was sitting high up in the tree, and nodded to them, saying, \"To-day is the golden wedding!\"", "And then she took two flowers out of her wreath and kissed them.", "They glittered at first like silver, then like gold, and when she placed them on the heads of the old people each flower became a golden crown.", "There they both sat like a king and queen under the sweet-smelling tree, which looked exactly like an elder-tree, and he told his wife the story of the elder-tree mother as it had been told him when he was a little boy.", "They were both of opinion that the story contained many points like their own, and these similarities they liked best.", "And the old man opened his prayer-book; the elder-blossom was still in it, and as fresh as if it had only just been put in.", "Remembrance nodded, and the two old people, with the golden crowns on their heads, sat in the glowing evening sun.", "They closed their eyes and- and- Well, now the story is ended!", "How beautiful it was! said the little boy.", "Mother, I have been to warm countries!", "I believe you, said the mother; \"if one takes two cups of hot elder-tea it is quite natural that one gets into warm countries!\"", "What do they do that for,\" she asked, of the student who sat on the sofa; she liked him very much, he could tell the most amusing stories, and cut out the prettiest pictures; hearts, and ladies dancing, castles with doors that opened, as well as flowers; he was a delightful student.", "When it grows dark, and everybody is asleep, they jump about quite merrily.\r\n8:8\tN:N\tN:H\tThey have a ball almost every night.", "You must know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town, the flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you should see how merry they are.\r\n20:20\tN:N\tN:H\tThe two most beautiful roses seat themselves on the throne, and are called the king and queen, then all the red cockscombs range themselves on each side, and bow, these are the lords-in-waiting.\r\n21:21\tN:N\tN:H\tAfter that the pretty flowers come in, and there is a grand ball.\r\n22:22\tN:N\tN:H\tThe blue violets represent little naval cadets, and dance with hyacinths and crocuses which they call young ladies.\r\n23:23\tN:N\tN:H\tThe tulips and tiger-lilies are the old ladies who sit and watch the dancing, so that everything may be conducted with order and propriety.", "Oh how capital, said little Ida, clapping her hands.", "Should I be able to see these flowers?", "It may be, however, that the flowers in the Botanical Gardens have never been to the king's palace, and, therefore, they know nothing of the merry doings at night, which take place there.", "How he will wonder what has become of them!\"", "Oh how funny! said Ida, and she laughed.", "But to little Ida, all these stories which the student told her about the flowers, seemed very droll, and she thought over them a great deal.", "Then she whispered to them quite softly, \"I know you are going to a ball to-night.\"", "But the flowers appeared as if they did not understand, and not a leaf moved; still Ida felt quite sure she knew all about it.", "She lay awake a long time after she was in bed, thinking how pretty it must be to see all the beautiful flowers dancing in the king's garden.", "I wonder if my flowers have really been there, she said to herself, and then she fell asleep.", "She raised herself a little, and glanced at the door of the room where all her flowers and playthings lay;

there lay the sick flowers, but they got up directly, and nodded to the others as a sign that they wished to dance with them.", "The old rough doll, with the broken mouth, stood up and bowed to the pretty flowers.", "They did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.", "The carnival rod hopped about among the flowers on its three red stilted feet, and stamped quite loud when it danced the Mazurka;

soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king\"s daughter, when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a hundred years.", "But scarcely had she touched it, before the fairy\"s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell down lifeless on the ground.", "This, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.", "But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said,

asked: \"Why are you weeping?\"", "Ah, said Elsie, \"have I not reason to weep?", "Then said the boy: \"What a clever Elsie we have!\" and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly.", "The woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down.", "Then said the mother likewise: \"What a clever Elsie we have!\" and sat down and wept with them.", "But when he got into the cellar, and they

pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: \"Oh, what a clever Elsie!\" and sat down, and likewise wept with them.", "When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting quite piteously, each outdoing the other.", "Ah, dear Hans, said Elsie, \"if we marry each other and have a child, and he is big, and

his pocket and gave her what he had.", "Let us leave him that, said the young lady; \"he has already lost his wealth.\"", "So she did as the old woman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, \"What makes you so sad?\"", "Alas! dear sir, said she, \"yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow,

knees before him, and said, \"O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much.", "Then she was much grieved, and went to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what had become of them.", "So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and

rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.", "Then the dwarf said,

away; but what can I do to earn my livelihood?\"", "They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the road and making a most rueful face.", "Because I am beginning to grow old,
